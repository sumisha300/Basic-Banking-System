Basic Banking System


Overview

This is a simple console-based basic banking system implemented in Python. It allows users to register, login, check their account balance, deposit money, and withdraw money. The user data is stored in two dictionaries - one for user information (username and password) and another for account balances.

Features

User Registration: Users can register by providing a unique username and a password. The system checks if the username is already taken.

User Login: Registered users can log in by providing their username and password. The system verifies their credentials and grants access upon successful login.

Check Balance: After logging in, users can check their account balance.

Deposit Money: Users can deposit money into their account by specifying the amount they wish to deposit. The system ensures that only positive amounts are accepted.

Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money from their account by specifying the amount they wish to withdraw. The system checks for sufficient account balance and valid withdrawal amounts.

Logout: Users can log out of their account, which will return them to the main menu.
